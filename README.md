# SmartMeter Energy Consumption in London Households

This project demonstrates how Python was used in the processing and visualization of SmartMeter Energy Consumption Data from the Low Carbon London project.

The Low Carbon London project was led by UK Power Networks, a company that owns and maintains electricity cables and lines across London, the South East and East of England. As part of the LCL project, energy consumption readings were taken for a sample of 5,567 London Households between November 2011 and February 2014.
